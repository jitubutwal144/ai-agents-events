        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for generating human-like text, but they have limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these challenges, enhancing LLMs by integrating retrieval mechanisms. This approach ensures that the content LLMs produce is both contextually relevant and factually accurate. RAG acts as a bridge, connecting LLMs to vast knowledge sources. As AI becomes increasingly used for diverse tasks, the accuracy and relevance of the generated information are crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG meets this demand, making AI interactions more informative and context-aware.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What You Need for RAG Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "Before building out a RAG system, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the tools that make this process possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each tool plays a specific role, ensuring that the RAG system operates efficiently and effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLM**: At the heart of the system is the LLM, the core AI model responsible for generating human-like text responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vector Store**: This is where the magic happens. The Vector Store is a dedicated storage system that houses embeddings and their corresponding textual data, ensuring quick and efficient retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vector Store Retriever**: Think of this as the search engine of the system. The Vector Store Retriever fetches relevant documents by comparing vector similarities, ensuring that the most pertinent information is always at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Embedder**: Before storing or retrieving data, we need to convert textual information into a format the system can understand. The Embedder takes on this role, transforming text into vector representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prompt**: Every interaction starts with a user's query or statement. The Prompt captures this initial input, setting the stage for the retrieval and generation processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Document Loader**: With vast amounts of data to process, the Document Loader is essential. It imports and reads documents, preparing them for chunking and embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Document Chunker**: To make the data more manageable and efficient for retrieval, the Document Chunker breaks documents into smaller, more digestible pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "**User Input**: Last but not least, the User Input tool captures the query or statement provided by the end-user, initiating the entire RAG process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# The RAG System and Its Subsystems\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal of RAG is to provide LLMs with contextually relevant and factually accurate information, ensuring that the generated content meets the highest standards of quality and relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, the RAG system is divided into subsystems, each playing a crucial role in the overall process. The tools integral to the RAG system are not standalone entities; they interweave to form the subsystems that drive the RAG process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each tool fits within one of the following subsystems:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Index\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Augment\n",
        "\n",
        "These work together as an orchestrated flow that transforms a user's query into a contextually rich and accurate response.\n"
